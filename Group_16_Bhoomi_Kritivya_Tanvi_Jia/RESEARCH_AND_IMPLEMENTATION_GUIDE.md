## 1. Mathematical and Algorithmic Formulation

### 1.1 START Protocol Decision Logic
The Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment (START) algorithm (`Benson1996`) categorizes casualties into four clinical priorities: Minor (Green), Delayed (Yellow), Immediate (Red), and Expectant/Deceased (Black) using a deterministic decision tree:

$$\text{Category}(i) = \begin{cases} \text{Green} & \text{if } \text{CanWalk}(i) = \text{True} \\ \text{Black} & \text{if } \text{CanWalk}(i) = \text{False} \land \text{RespirationRate}(i) = 0 \text{ (after airway repositioning)} \\ \text{Red} & \text{if } \text{RespirationRate}(i) > 30\text{ bpm} \lor \text{RadialPulse}(i) = \text{Absent} \lor \text{FollowsCommands}(i) = \text{False} \\ \text{Yellow} & \text{otherwise (spontaneous respiration } \le 30\text{ bpm}, \text{pulse present, follows commands)} \end{cases}$$

### 1.2 Triage Confusion Matrix & Error Metrics
Under-triage (classifying an Immediate Red patient into Yellow or Green) leads to preventable death; over-triage (classifying Green/Yellow as Red) exhausts intensive care transport and operating room capacity (`Lerner2008`):

$$R_{\text{undertriage}} = \frac{FN_{\text{Red}}}{\sum \text{True Red Casualties}} = \frac{N(\text{True}=\text{Red} \land \text{Pred} \in \{\text{Yellow}, \text{Green}, \text{Black}\})}{N(\text{True}=\text{Red})}$$

$$R_{\text{overtriage}} = \frac{FP_{\text{Red}}}{\sum \text{Predicted Red Casualties}} = \frac{N(\text{True} \in \{\text{Yellow}, \text{Green}\} \land \text{Pred}=\text{Red})}{N(\text{Pred}=\text{Red})}$$

Overall classification agreement beyond chance is quantified by Cohen's kappa coefficient ($\kappa_{\text{triage}}$):

$$\kappa_{\text{triage}} = \frac{P_o - P_e}{1 - P_e}$$

where $P_o$ is the observed accuracy and $P_e$ is the expected hypothetical chance probability.

### 1.3 Spatial Telemetry & Decision Latency
Trainee position $\mathbf{p}(t) = [x(t), y(t), z(t)]^T$ and forward head gaze vector $\hat{\mathbf{g}}(t)$ are logged at 20 Hz. The assessment latency per casualty $\Delta t_{\text{triage}}$ is:

$$\Delta t_{\text{triage}}(i) = t_{\text{tag\_applied}}(i) - t_{\text{approach}}(i)$$

where $t_{\text{approach}}$ is the timestamp when trainee distance to casualty $i$ is within $1.5\text{ meters}$.

### 1.4 Technoeconomic Operational Parity Model
The institutional training efficiency is quantified by the dimensionless operational cost parity ratio $\kappa$:

$$\kappa = \frac{\text{OpEx}_{\text{VR}}}{\text{OpEx}_{\text{Live}}} = \frac{C_{\text{headset\_sanitization}} + C_{\text{software\_licensing}} + C_{\text{supervisory\_staff}}}{C_{\text{actor\_moulage}} + C_{\text{site\_rental}} + C_{\text{consumable\_waste}} + C_{\text{instructor\_hours}}}$$

The capital investment payback horizon in operating months is:

$$\text{Payback Months} = \frac{12 \cdot K_{\text{capex}}}{\text{OpEx}_{\text{Live}} \cdot (1 - \kappa)}$$

### 3.2 Testing Protocol
1. **Scene Initialization:** Load chemical refinery scene; confirm 50 autonomous casualties spawn with appropriate ground-truth tags.
2. **Mobility Broadcast:** Audio announcement triggers walking wounded casualties to migrate to the designated decontamination zone.
3. **Casualty Evaluation:** Trainee navigates through hazards to each victim, evaluates breathing, checks pulse, tests verbal response, and applies ribbon.
4. **Telemetry Verification:** Confirm `mci_triage_benchmark.csv` logs all 50 casualty assessment trials with exact coordinates and latencies.

## 4. Empirical Benchmark & Statistical Testing Framework

### 4.1 Formal Hypotheses
- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):** Immersive AI-driven VR triage simulation does not improve START categorization accuracy or reduce decision latency compared to traditional didactic training:
  $$\mu_{\text{Accuracy, VR}} = \mu_{\text{Accuracy, Control}}, \quad \mu_{\text{Latency, VR}} = \mu_{\text{Latency, Control}}$$
- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$):** Immersive AI-driven VR triage simulation significantly improves categorization accuracy and cuts assessment latency:
  $$\mu_{\text{Accuracy, VR}} > \mu_{\text{Accuracy, Control}} \quad (p < 0.001), \quad \mu_{\text{Latency, VR}} < \mu_{\text{Latency, Control}} \quad (p < 0.001)$$
