## 1. Mathematical and Algorithmic Formulation

### 1.1 Networked State Synchronization & Hermite Spline Interpolation
Shared 3D puzzle manipulation across networked clients requires continuous transform synchronization. To mask packet jitter and latency, the position vector $\mathbf{p}(t)$ is interpolated between received network state packets using cubic Hermite splines (`Wolff2004`):

$$\mathbf{p}(t) = (2\tau^3 - 3\tau^2 + 1)\mathbf{p}_k + (\tau^3 - 2\tau^2 + \tau)\Delta t \mathbf{v}_k + (-2\tau^3 + 3\tau^2)\mathbf{p}_{k+1} + (\tau^3 - \tau^2)\Delta t \mathbf{v}_{k+1}$$

where $\tau = \frac{t - t_k}{t_{k+1} - t_k} \in [0, 1]$, and $\mathbf{v}_k$ is the linear velocity at timestamp $t_k$.

### 1.2 Spatial 3D HRTF Filtering & Logarithmic Attenuation
Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) model acoustic diffraction around the listener's head, pinnae, and torso (`Baldis2001`). For a speaker position $\mathbf{p}_s$ and listener head orientation $(\theta, \phi)$, the binaural pressure signals $s_L(t)$ and $s_R(t)$ are:

$$s_L(t) = s_{\text{raw}}(t) * h_L(t, \theta, \phi, d), \quad s_R(t) = s_{\text{raw}}(t) * h_R(t, \theta, \phi, d)$$

Distance-based sound pressure level attenuation $A(d)$ follows the inverse-distance logarithmic law:

$$A(d) = A_0 \cdot \frac{d_{\text{ref}}}{\max(d_{\text{ref}}, d)}$$

where $d_{\text{ref}} = 1.0\text{ m}$.

### 1.3 Cooperative Manipulation & Dual-Hand Grab Arbitration
When two clients simultaneously grasp an identical puzzle piece, the resulting rigid body transform is arbitrated via weighted kinematic fusion (`Pinho2002`):

$$\mathbf{p}_{\text{piece}}(t) = w_A \mathbf{p}_{\text{grab}, A}(t) + w_B \mathbf{p}_{\text{grab}, B}(t)$$

$$\mathbf{q}_{\text{piece}}(t) = \text{Slerp}\left(\mathbf{q}_{\text{grab}, A}(t), \mathbf{q}_{\text{grab}, B}(t), \frac{w_B}{w_A + w_B}\right)$$

where weights $w_A = w_B = 0.5$ for symmetric dual manipulation.

### 1.4 Verbal Coordination Dynamics & Speech Overlap
Grounded in conversational analysis for CVEs (`Ruddle2002`), speech collision and overlap ratio $R_{\text{overlap}}$ over total task duration $T$ is quantified as:

$$R_{\text{overlap}} = \frac{\int_0^T \mathbb{I}(\text{VAD}_A(t) \land \text{VAD}_B(t)) \, dt}{\int_0^T \mathbb{I}(\text{VAD}_A(t) \lor \text{VAD}_B(t)) \, dt}$$

where $\text{VAD}_i(t) \in \{0, 1\}$ represents real-time Voice Activity Detection. The Collaborative Efficiency Index (CEI) is:

$$\text{CEI} = \frac{N_{\text{assembled}}}{T_{\text{task}}} \cdot 100 \cdot (1 - R_{\text{overlap}})$$

### 1.5 Technoeconomic Operational Parity Model
Engineering laboratory training efficiency is evaluated via the dimensionless cost parity ratio $\kappa$:

$$\kappa = \frac{\text{OpEx}_{\text{VR}}}{\text{OpEx}_{\text{Physical}}} = \frac{C_{\text{headset\_maintenance}} + C_{\text{server\_bandwidth}} + C_{\text{software\_licensing}}}{C_{\text{prototyping\_consumables}} + C_{\text{tool\_wear}} + C_{\text{lab\_bench\_upkeep}} + C_{\text{supervision\_hours}}}$$

The capital investment payback horizon in operating months is:

$$\text{Payback Months} = \frac{12 \cdot K_{\text{capex}}}{\text{OpEx}_{\text{Physical}} \cdot (1 - \kappa)}$$

## 4. Empirical Benchmark & Statistical Testing Framework

### 4.1 Formal Hypotheses
- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):** Real-time 3D spatial voice communication does not reduce task completion time or speech collision ratio compared to non-spatial stereo voice:
  $$\mu_{\text{Time, Spatial}} = \mu_{\text{Time, Stereo}}, \quad \mu_{\text{Overlap, Spatial}} = \mu_{\text{Overlap, Stereo}}$$
- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$):** Real-time 3D spatial voice communication significantly reduces assembly completion latency and verbal speech collisions:
  $$\mu_{\text{Time, Spatial}} < \mu_{\text{Time, Stereo}} \quad (p < 0.001), \quad \mu_{\text{Overlap, Spatial}} < \mu_{\text{Overlap, Stereo}} \quad (p < 0.001)$$
