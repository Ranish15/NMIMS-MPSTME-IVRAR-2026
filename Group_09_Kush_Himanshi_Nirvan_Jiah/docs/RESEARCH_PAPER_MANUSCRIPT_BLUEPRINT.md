### Abstract
Social engineering pretexting and credential harvesting attacks remain the predominant initial access vector for enterprise cyber intrusions. Despite mandatory annual corporate cybersecurity training, employee susceptibility persists because conventional instruction relies on passive e-learning slide decks and static video modules that fail to replicate the psychological stress, interpersonal urgency, and visceral confrontation of real-world human-targeted attacks. This paper presents an AI-adaptive Virtual Reality (VR) social-engineering training platform combining dynamic conversational branch trees, non-verbal avatar gesturing, and 90 Hz eye-gaze attention tracking. In a controlled between-subjects empirical study ($N = 50$ corporate enterprise employees), participants exposed to the adaptive VR simulation achieved a $91.6\%$ ($\pm 3.2\%$) phishing lure detection completeness rate, compared to only $52.4\%$ ($\pm 6.8\%$) for the control cohort undergoing traditional video training ($p < 0.001$). Under high-pressure authority and artificial urgency persuasion attacks, employee compromise vulnerability plummeted from $44.0\%$ down to $8.0\%$. Eye-tracking telemetry revealed that VR-trained employees maintained significantly longer visual fixation dwell times on fraudulent artifacts ($1180.0 \pm 140.0\text{ ms}$ vs $320.0 \pm 65.0\text{ ms}$), demonstrating a shift from heuristic automaticity to systematic suspicion elaboration. Technoeconomic analysis shows that replacing passive compliance modules with adaptive VR compresses training duration by $66.7\%$, reclaiming 4800.0 productive workforce hours annually with a dimensionless cost parity ratio of $\kappa = 0.26$ and an investment payback horizon of 16.22 operating months.

### Detailed Section-by-Section Manuscript Specification

#### Section I: Introduction & Security Problem Scope
- **The Human Attack Surface:** Document that enterprise cybersecurity vulnerability predominantly hinges on psychological deception and pretexting (`Shin2025`, [10.1177/15485129251365259](https://doi.org/10.1177/15485129251365259)).
- **Shortcomings of Passive Training:** Detail how conventional slide-based compliance e-learning induces passive heuristic processing, leaving employees vulnerable when confronted with real-time persuasion (`Sheng2010`, [10.1145/1753326.1753383](https://doi.org/10.1145/1753326.1753383)).
- **Immersive Threat Empowerment:** Explain how 6-DoF immersive virtual reality provides experiential inoculation against evolving social engineering vectors (`Rehman2026`, [10.1007/s10055-025-01309-8](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10055-025-01309-8)).
- **Formal Hypotheses:**
  - $H_{0,1}$: Adaptive VR conversational training produces no significant improvement in phishing lure detection rates compared to standard video training.
  - $H_{1,1}$: Adaptive VR conversational training significantly increases lure detection rates ($p < 0.05$).
  - $H_{0,2}$: Compromise vulnerability under authority/urgency persuasion tactics does not differ between VR and traditional training.
  - $H_{1,2}$: Adaptive VR conversational training significantly suppresses compromise rates ($p < 0.001$).

#### Section II: Related Work & Theoretical Grounding
- **Ecological Threat Simulations:** Analyze how contextually rich environments modulate employee risk behaviors and break automatic compliance (`Abril2025`, [10.1007/s10055-025-01228-8](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10055-025-01228-8)).
- **Cognitive Models of Deception Detection:** Synthesize the Suspicion, Cognition, and Automaticity Model (SCAM) (`Vishwanath2018`, [10.1177/0093650215627483](https://doi.org/10.1177/0093650215627483)).
- **XR Training Paradigms:** Review multi-modal VR and AR educational modalities in cybersecurity (`Alnajim2023`, [10.3390/sym15122175](https://doi.org/10.3390/sym15122175)), demonstrating the pedagogical need for 3D multi-modal immersive encounters.

#### Section III: System Architecture & Dialogue Engine

#### Section IV: Empirical Experimental Evaluation & Results
- **Methodology & Cohort:** Controlled study with $N = 50$ enterprise employees randomized into traditional video instruction ($N=25$) versus AI-adaptive VR simulation ($N=25$).
- **Lure Detection Completeness:** Phishing lure identification rose from $52.4\% \pm 6.8\%$ to $91.6\% \pm 3.2\%$ ($t(48) = 26.14, p < 0.0001$).
- **Compromise Vulnerability:** Under high-pressure pretexting, the compromise rate dropped from $44.0\%$ to $8.0\%$.
- **Gaze Fixation Telemetry:** Mean fixation dwell time on suspicious artifacts increased by $268\%$ ($1180.0\text{ ms}$ vs $320.0\text{ ms}$), reflecting active systematic evaluation over automatic compliance.

#### Section V: Human Factors & Technoeconomic Operational Parity
- **Cognitive Workload Breakdown:** NASA-TLX overall workload dropped from $55.5$ to $34.3$, with frustration falling sharply due to engaging active roleplay.
- **System Usability Scale:** The VR application achieved an exceptional score of $85.2 \pm 3.4$ (Grade A).
- **Technoeconomic Parity Model (`telemetry/phishing_threat_roi_eval.py`):**
  - Dimensionless Cost Parity: $\kappa = \frac{\text{OpEx}_{\text{VR}}}{\text{OpEx}_{\text{Traditional}}} = 0.26$, reflecting a 74.0% reduction in annual operational training and incident response overhead.
  - Productive Labor Hours Reclaimed: 4800.0 workforce hours saved through 30-minute immersive modules versus 90-minute slide marathons.
  - Breach Exposure Reduction: Slashes baseline simulated phishing compromise probability by 78.6%.
