## 1. Mathematical and Algorithmic Formulation

### 1.1 Conversational Branch State Machine & Persuasion Transition Matrix
The social-engineering adversary is modeled as a discrete-time Markov Decision Process (MDP) over dialogue state space $\mathcal{S}$ with action space $\mathcal{A}$ representing Cialdini persuasion tactics (None, Authority, Urgency, Scarcity, Reciprocity, Social Proof):

$$P(s_{t+1} = j \mid s_t = i, a_t = k) = T_{ij}(k)$$

where transition probabilities $T_{ij}(k)$ depend upon the employee's verbal compliance or resistance score $R \in [0, 1]$:

$$R = w_{\text{lex}} \cdot S_{\text{intent}} + w_{\text{lat}} \cdot \sigma(\Delta t_{\text{resp}}) + w_{\text{gaze}} \cdot G_{\text{lure}}$$

where:
- $S_{\text{intent}}$ is the classified semantic intent (challenge vs compliance).
- $\sigma(\Delta t_{\text{resp}})$ is the normalized response deliberation latency.
- $G_{\text{lure}}$ is the gaze fixation attention index on fraudulent cues.

If resistance $R < R_{\text{threshold}}$, the dialogue transitions into an exploitation node; if $R \ge R_{\text{threshold}}$, the adversary branches into an alternative persuasion tactic (e.g. escalating from Authority to Urgency).

### 1.2 Eye-Gaze Fixation Dwell Time & Attention Distribution
Visual attention on physical deceptive artifacts (forged ID badges, fraudulent USB drives, spoofed email headers) is captured at 90 Hz via gaze raycasting. The cumulative fixation dwell time $D_k$ on artifact $k$ with bounding collider $\mathcal{C}_k$ is:

$$D_k = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \mathbb{I}\left(\mathbf{r}_{\text{gaze}}(t) \cap \mathcal{C}_k \ne \emptyset\right) \cdot \Delta t$$

where $\mathbb{I}(\cdot)$ is the indicator function. In accordance with the Suspicion, Cognition, and Automaticity Model (SCAM) (`Vishwanath2018`), visual fixations exceeding the threshold $D_k \ge 500\text{ ms}$ signal active cognitive suspicion elaboration, significantly increasing the probability of threat detection.

### 1.3 Threat Detection Sensitivity & Susceptibility
Employee detection performance is formalized using signal detection theory:

$$d' = \Phi^{-1}(\text{Hit Rate}) - \Phi^{-1}(\text{False Alarm Rate})$$

where:
- $\text{Hit Rate}$ is the proportion of fraudulent social engineering lures correctly challenged.
- $\text{False Alarm Rate}$ is the proportion of legitimate corporate procedures erroneously flagged.
- $\Phi^{-1}$ is the inverse cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.

### 1.4 Technoeconomic Operational Parity
The economic feasibility of the AI-adaptive VR simulation versus traditional passive video/slide compliance e-learning is modeled via the dimensionless cost parity ratio $\kappa$:

$$\kappa = \frac{\text{OpEx}_{\text{VR}}}{\text{OpEx}_{\text{Traditional}}} = \frac{C_{\text{NLP\_inference}} + C_{\text{workstation\_maintenance}} + C_{\text{scenario\_updates}}}{C_{\text{incident\_triage}} + C_{\text{LMS\_licensing}} + C_{\text{compliance\_admin}}}$$

The capital investment payback horizon in operating months is:

$$\text{Payback Months} = \frac{K_{\text{capex}}}{1 - \kappa} \times 12$$
